## 🌍 About
Kenya Tourism is a focused, static site showcasing the beauty, culture, and major destinations of Kenya 🇰🇪.  
This repository contains the static front-end (plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript) used for the site that's hosted with GitHub Pages. The project aims to be fast, mobile-friendly and usable offline where possible.

Why this project exists:
- Promote Kenya’s tourism highlights in a lightweight, accessible format.
- Provide a simple template for building static tourism/microsite pages.
- Demonstrate clean, framework-free front-end development.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 Fully static (vanilla HTML, CSS, JS) — no build tools required  
- 📱 Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- ⚡ Lightweight assets and offline-friendly caching patterns  
- 🌐 Hosted on GitHub Pages (live demo link above)  
- 🎨 Interactive README and repository-level stats (below)  
- 💾 Easy to fork, modify and deploy for other destinations
