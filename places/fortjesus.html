    <p>
      Standing proudly at the entrance of Mombasa’s Old Town harbor, Fort Jesus is a 16th-century masterpiece built by the Portuguese to guard their trade route. 
      Every brick tells a story of battles, sea breezes, and centuries of culture clashing and mingling.

  <section class="storytelling">
    <h2>Walk Through Time</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine stepping off the cobbled streets of Mombasa Old Town into a fortress where time slows. Each wall is layered with history, echoes of cannon fire and marching footsteps still in the air. 
      The smell of the sea mixes with old stones and the whispers of ancient traders. You wander past arches and watchtowers, capturing photographs at every angle, while feeling connected to centuries of stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      By sunset, the fort transforms. Orange and pink hues reflect on the Indian Ocean, the walls turn golden, and you realize — history here isn’t just something you read about, it’s something you feel.
